        <p>When you think of coding, what’s the first thing that comes to mind? For some, it may be building a website. For others, you may only be able to picture someone hacking into the government’s mainframe computer. Either way, many of you have probably heard something about coding and have varying degrees of knowledge of it.</p>
<p>  When I was a kid, my parents had an old school DOS computer. For those of you who don’t know what that is, it is a dinosaur of computers which could either play prehistoric games or run a command line that looked something like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.lian98.biz/liandos/doc.en/images/u_term_01.gif" alt="DOS Command-line"></p>
<p>I remember trying to type commands such as “Blow Up” or “Do Something” into my computer, but none of them did anything because I didn’t know the coding language and frankly didn’t know how to communicate with my computer.</p>
<p>  It wasn’t until I was about 18 years old that I actually began to learn coding languages. I began with some basic languages for building websites such as HTML and CSS. HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language is used to build the structure of a webpage, application or software. Basically, if HTML didn’t exist, you wouldn’t be able to read what I’m writing right now unless I was using a typewriter. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets is the language you use to style your webpage. Have you ever went to a webpage and all you saw was text on the left of the screen and everything looked broken? Chances are, the sites’ CSS was either broken or didn’t load correctly. That, or their IT guy really hates his boss… yikes!</p>
<p>  Once I started to learn how websites are built and styled, I really began to grasp how to find things on the internet. I no longer typed complete sentences into Google because Google isn’t a person. Google finds key-words in your search and finds relevant information. Everything just started to make sense. </p>
<p>  Let’s face it, how many times do you use technology? Let’s see… you wake up and check facebook, then you check your weather app and catch an Uber to work… And that’s before you even hit 9am! Everything revolves around technology and if you want to be relevant in tomorrow’s day and age, learning a bit of code couldn’t hurt.</p>
<p>If I could go back and learn coding languages earlier in life, I would have. Someone I look up to once said that everyone should learn a bit of code because then if your company’s website needs fixing, you can jump in and become an asset to your boss and the whole company. I’ve only touched on two coding languages and there are many out there. Languages that build, style, change what’s built, build what’s built. There is so much out there to learn, so parents, please… please put a computer in your kids’ hands and teach them to code. You are never too young or too old to learn to code. Here’s to you and your future in technology!</p>
