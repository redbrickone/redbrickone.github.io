My boss at CodeKoalas asked that we each read Dale Carnegie's book "How to Win Friends and Influence People." As my blog is usually only about code, I won't go into full detail about the book, but there were several key points I wanted to mention.
According to Dale Carnegie, this is how to win friends and influence people:

* Be genuinely nice to people
* Look them in the eye and smile when talking to them
* Don't always talk about yourself
* If you are confronting someone about an issue, don't begin by criticizing them or even talking about your issue. Begin by lifting them up and encouraging them. This lowers their guard and gives you a better chance at getting your issue resolved.

I know from expereince that if you follow these principles, you will have success in making friends and influencing people.
